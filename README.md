# StatsProc
**Statistical and Machine Learning processor**

**StatsProc** project aims to create an automatic tool for Data Science and Machine Learning jobs, giving everyone the power to complete such tasks without programming. 

It will be a **FOSS** (Free and Open Source Software) forever. Our goal is to take Data Science to everyone, including elementary and high scools. 

# We want developers!
